My First Big Project in Programming

This is one of the first significant projects I built during my programming journey. Although it's an older project, I wanted to share it as a way to preserve and reflect on my progress.

The project is a Restaurant Order System built using the Tkinter library in Python. To run the project, simply execute the main.py file after installing the necessary dependencies, such as Pandas and Tkinter.

While I initially thought the OOP and the code implementation was a bit amateurish, revisiting the code made me realize itâ€™s actually not bad at all! ðŸ˜„.
